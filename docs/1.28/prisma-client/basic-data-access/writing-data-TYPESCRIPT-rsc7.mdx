## Overview

The Prisma client is generated from your [datamodel](knul). Its API exposes CRUD and other operations for the models defined in the datamodel.

For this page, we'll assume your Prisma project is based on the following datamodel:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  title: String!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
  author: User
  comments: [Comment!]!
}

type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  name: String
  email: String! @unique
  role: Role! @default(value: "USER")
  posts: [Post!]!
  comments: [Comment!]!
}

type Comment {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  text: String!
  post: Post!
  writtenBy: User!
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}
```

<Warning>

The syntax of this datamodel is based on the datamodel v1. If you're using the [MongoDB connector](jgfm), you're already using the next version of the [datamodel v1.1](b6a7) which looks a bit different (learn more [here](knun)). The generated API operations will be the same with a few exceptions that are highlighted on this page.

</Warning>

For each model type in your datamodel, six methods for writing data are generated. For example, for the `User` model the following operations are available:

- `createUser`: Creates a new `User` record in the database 
- `updateUser`: Updates an existing `User` record in the database
- `deleteUser`: Deletes an existing `User` record from the database
- `upsertUser`: Updates an existing or create a new `User` record in the database
- `updateManyUsers`: Updates many existing `User` records in the database at once. 
- `deleteManyUsers`: Deletes many existing `User` records from the database at once.

## Creating records

When creating new records in the database, the `create`-method takes one input object which wraps all the scalar fields of the record to be created. It also provides a way to create relational data for the model, this can be supplied using [nested object writes](#nested-object-writes).

Each method call returns a Promise for an object that contains all the scalar fields of the model that was just created.

### Examples

_Create a new user_:

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const newUser: User = await prisma
  .createUser({
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@prisma.io",
  })
```

```js
{
  id: 'cjswxd4t7379v0b56geckqnoy',
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@prisma,io',
  role: 'USER'
}
```

</Code>

_Create a new post and set `alice@prisma.io` as the author_:

> When using the **MySQL** or **Postgres** databases connectors, the following call is executed as a single database transaction. The **MongoDB** connector [doesn't support transactions yet](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3785). Learn more in the [Declarative nest writes](#declarative-nested-writes) section.

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const post: Post = prisma.createPost({
    title: "Join us for GraphQL Conf in 2019",
    author: {
      connect: { email: "alice@prisma.io" }
    }
  })
```

```js
{ 
  id: 'cjswxmho93a5m0b56nyui0yub',
  updatedAt: '2019-03-06T08:20:17.529Z',
  createdAt: '2019-03-06T08:20:17.529Z',
  published: false,
  title: 'Join us for GraphQL Conf in 2019' 
}
```

</Code>

_Create a new user with two new posts_:

> When using the **MySQL** or **Postgres** databases connectors, the following call is executed as a single database transaction. The **MongoDB** connector [doesn't support transactions yet](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3785).

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const newUser: User = await prisma
  .createUser({
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@prisma.io",
    posts: {
      create: [{
        title: "Follow Prisma on Twitter",
      }, {
        title: "Join us for GraphQL Conf in 2019",
      }]
    }, 
  })
```

```js
{
  id: 'cjswy0ig53cg60b56evl2ow46',
  name: 'Bob',
  email: 'bob@prisma.io',
  role: 'USER'
}
```

</Code>

## Updating records

When updating existing records in the database, the `update`-method receives one input object with two fields:

- `data`: This is similar to the input object you provide to a `create`-method. It wraps scalar fields of the model to be updated and lets you provide relational data via [nested object writes](#nested-object-writes).
- `where`: This is used to select the record that should be updated. You can use any [unique](knul#unique-scalar-fields) field to identify the record. For the example datamodel above, this means that for `User`, `Post` and `Comment` it has an `id` property. For `User` it additionally accepts the `email` field.

Each method call returns a Promise for an object that contains all the scalar fields of the model that was just updated.

### Examples

_Update the role of an existing user_:

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const updatedUser: User = await prisma
  .updateUser({
    data: {
      role: "ADMIN"
    },
    where: {
      id: "cjli512bd005g0a233s1ogbgy"
    }
  })
```

```js
{
  id: 'cjswxd4t7379v0b56geckqnoy',
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@prisma.io',
  role: 'ADMIN'
}
```

</Code>

_Update the author of a post_:

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const updatedPost: Post = await prisma
  .updatePost({
    data: {
      author: {
        connect: { email: "bob@prisma.io" }
      },
    },
    where: { id: "cjli47wr3005b0a23m9crhh0e" }
  })
```

```js
{
  id: 'cjswxd4t7379v0b56geckqnoy',
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@prisma.io',
  role: 'ADMIN'
}
```

</Code>

## Deleting records

When deleting records from the database, the `delete`-method receives one input object that specifies which record is to be deleted. The type of this input object is identical to the `where` object in `update`-methods.

The properties of that object correspond to those fields of the model that are marked as [unique](knul#unique-scalar-fields). For the example datamodel above, this means that for `User`, `Post` and `Comment` it has an `id` property. For `User` it additionally accepts the `email` field.

Each method call returns a Promise for object that contains all the scalar fields of the model that was just deleted.

### Examples

_Delete a post by its id_:

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const deletedPost: Post = await prisma
  .deletePost({
    id: "cjli47wr3005b0a23m9crhh0e"
  })
```

```js
{
  id: 'cjsviilj20g8u0b434rujzkt5',
  createdAt: '2019-03-05T08:29:35.483Z',
  updatedAt: '2019-03-05T08:29:35.483Z',
  title: 'Join us for GraphQL Conf 2019',
  published: false,
}
```

</Code>

_Delete a user by their email_:

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const deletedUser: User = await prisma
  .deleteUser({
    email: "alice@prisma.io"
  })
```

```js
{
  id: 'cjswxd4t7379v0b56geckqnoy',
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@prisma,io',
  role: 'USER'
}
```

</Code>

## Creating or updating objects (upserts)

Upsert operations allow you to _try_ to update an existing record. If that record actually does not exist yet, it will be created. The `upsert`-methods are a mix of `create`- and `update`-methods, meaning they receive an input argument that has three fields:

- `where`: Identical to the `where` field provided in `update`-methods
- `update`: Identical to the `data` field provided in `update`-methods
- `create`: Identical to the input object provide in `create`-methods

### Examples

_Update the role of a user. If the user doesn't exist yet, create a new one_:

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const updatedOrCreatedUser: User = await prisma
  .upsertUser({
    where: {
      email: "alice@prisma.io"
    },
    update: {
      role: "ADMIN"
    },
    create: {
      name: "Alice",
      email: "alice@prisma.io",
      role: "ADMIN",
    }
  })
```

```js
{
  id: 'cjswxd4t7379v0b56geckqnoy',
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@prisma.io',
  role: 'ADMIN'
}
```

</Code>

## Updating and deleting many records in bulk

The Prisma client API offers special methods to update or delete many records at once. Each `updateMany`- and `deleteMany`-method returns the _number_ of records that ultimately have been affected by the operation.

### Examples

_Unpublish three posts by their IDs_:

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const updatedPostCount: number = await prisma
  .updateManyPosts({
    where: {
      id_in: ["cjsviilio0g8f0b430jbnyvi7", "cjli6tnkj005x0a2325ynfpb9", "cjli6tq3200620a23s4lp8npd"]
    },
    data: { published: false },
  }).count()
```

```js
2
```

</Code>

<Warning>

If one of more of the provided IDs does not actually exist in the database, the operation will **not** return an error. The returned `count` indicates how many records actually were updated.

</Warning>

_Update all posts where the description contains the string `prisma` and publish them_:

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const updatedPostsCount: number = await prisma
  .updateManyPosts({
    where: { title_contains: "prisma" },
    data: { published: true },
  }).count()
```

```graphql
1
```

</Code>

_Delete all posts that were created before 2018_:

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const deletePostsCount = await prisma
  .deleteManyPosts({
    createdAt_lte: "2018"
  }).count()
```

```js
42
```

</Code>

## Nested object writes

Nested object writes let you modify multiple database records across relations in a single transaction. Nested object writes are available for `create`- and `update`-methods.

<Warning>

The [MongoDB](jgfm) database connector currently does not support ACID transactions. Learn more in [this](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3738) GitHub issue.

</Warning>

Because the model `User` has a relation to `Post` via the `author` field, you can create/update/delete `Post` records through `createUser` and `updateUser` operations. In these cases, the `author` field in the `data` object for `createUser` and `updateUser` operations can contain one or more of the following keywords: 

- `create`: Creates a new `Post` record and connects it via the `author` field to the `User` record.
- `update`: Updates a `Post` record that is connected to a `User` record via the `author` field.
- `upsert`: Updates a `Post` record that is connected to a `User` record via the `author` field or creates a new `Post` record and connects it via the `author` field to the `User` record.
- `delete`: Deletes a `Post` record that is connected to a `User` record via the `author` field.
- `connect`: Connects a `Post` record to a `User` record via the `author` field.
- `disconnect`: Disconnects a `Post` record from a `User` record.
- `set`:  Connects a `Post` record to a `User` record via the `author` field. If the `Post` record was connected to a different `User` record before, it is disconnected from that one (`set` effecitvely executes `connect` and `disconnect` operations under the hood).

### Examples

_Create a new user with two new posts and connect one existing post_:

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const newUser: User = await prisma
  .createUser({
    name: "Bob",
    email: "bob@prisma.io",
    posts: {
      create: [{
        title: "Follow Prisma on Twitter",
      }, {
        title: "Join us for GraphQL Conf in 2019",
      }],
      connect: { id: "cjsviiljo0g9h0b43i943n4ni" }
    }
  })
```

```js
{
  id: 'cjsx0u2do3s0m0b5624n9jhwd',
  name: 'Bob',
  email: 'bob@prisma.io',
  role: 'USER'
}
```

</Code>

_Delete a comment of a user_:

<Code languages={["TypeScript", "Result"]}>

```js
const updatedUser: User = await prisma
  .updateUser({
    where: { id: "cjli8znnd006n0a23ywc6wf8w" },
    data: {
      comments: {
        delete: { id: "cjli6tknz005s0a23uf0lmlve" }
      }
    }
  })
```

```js
{
  id: 'cjsviiliz0g8t0b43zyu25usd',
  name: 'Grace',
  email: 'grace@prisma.io',
  role: 'USER'
}
```

</Code>
