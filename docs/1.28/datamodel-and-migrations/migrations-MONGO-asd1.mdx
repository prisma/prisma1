## Overview

MongoDB is a _schemaless_ database, which means it is _possible_ to insert data of various structures into it. MongoDB never complains because a piece of inserted data doesn't adhere to some predefined, expected format. This is different from relational databases where data that's inserted needs to adhere to the predefined [database schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema).

This changes when using MongoDB with Prisma. Prisma adds a "schema" (i.e. the Prisma [datamodel](knun)) on top of MongoDB. That's why _migrations_ now become a relevant topic when using MongoDB with Prisma.

The general process for performing a migration with Prisma is as follows:

1. Adjust the [datamodel](knun) file to reflect the new desired schema
1. Run [`prisma deploy`](xcv9) to apply the changes and perform the migration of the Prisma API (and potentially) the underlying MongoDB database)

When going through that process, Prisma will only ever make _additive_ structural changes to the underlying MongoDB database(s).

During a migration, **Prisma will never**:

- Delete an existing collection
- Rename an existing collection
- Drop an existing database
- Delete or change any field names on existing documents

<Warning>

Be aware that this might lead to _dangling collections or fields_, i.e. collections or fields that still exist in the underlying MongoDB database but that can't be accessed through the Prisma API.

</Warning>

During a migration, **Prisma might**:

- Create new collections
- Create new documents
- Create new fields on existing documents

## Examples

### Renaming a collection

#### Scenario 1: With the `@db` directive

Assume you have the following datamodel:

```graphql
type User @db(name: "users") {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
}
```

Because the `@db` directive is used on the type, the name of the type in the Prisma API is _decoupled_ from the name of the collection in the underlying MongoDB.

To rename the type in the Prisma API, you need to adjust the name of the type in your Prisma datamodel:

```graphql
type Person @db(name: "users") {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
}
```

To apply the changes and update the Prisma API, run `prisma deploy`.

#### Scenario 2: Without the `@db` directive

Assume you have the following datamodel:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
}
```

Because there is no `@db` directive, the collection in the underlying MongoDB is also called `User`.

To rename the type in the Prisma API, you need to adjust the name of the type in your Prisma datamodel:

```graphql
type Person {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
}
```

When running `prisma deploy`, there are three things done by Prisma:

- Remove CRUD operations for the `User` type from the Prisma API
- Expose CRUD operations for the new `Person` type in the Prisma API
- Create a new `Person` collection in the underlying database

The underlying `User` collection remains untouched, it stays there as a _dangling collection_.

If you want to still use the data in the dangling `User` collection for the new `Person` type in your Prisma API, you need to [manually rename the collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.renameCollection/) in your MongoDB (and likely delete the empty `Person` collection that was created earlier).

### Renaming a field of a collection

Assume you have the following datamodel:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
}
```

Now you want to rename the `name` field to `lastName`. This can actually mean three things:

1. You want to rename the field **only** in the Prisma API
1. You want to rename the field **only** in the underlying MongoDB
1. You want to rename the field in both, the Prisma API **and** the underlying MongoDB

#### Scenario 1: Renaming only in the Prisma API

If you want to rename the field only in the Prisma API, you can do so by changing the name of the field in the datamodel and addding the `@db` directive to create a mapping from the `lastName` datamodel field to the `name` field in the underlying MongoDB:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  lastName: String! @db(name: "name")
}
```

Now run `prisma deploy` to apply the changes.

#### Scenario 2: Renaming only in the underlying MongoDB

Because Prisma never performs any structural changes to your underlying MongoDB, the only way to achieve this is by [renaming the field manually](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/rename/).

After you've done this, your Prisma API of course has not changed. This also means that when you're now trying to retrieve the `name` of a document in the `User` collection via the Prisma API, Prisma will throw an error because the `name` does not exist any more in the underlying MongoDB.

To prevent this, you have two options:

- Delete the `name` field from the datamodel and run `prisma deploy`. This means there is no way to get access to the new `lastName` through Prisma.
- Also rename the field in the Prisma API, see the third scenario for more info on this.

#### Scenario 3: Renaming in the Prisma API and the underlying MongoDB

Similar to the second scenario, you first need to [manually rename the field](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/rename/) in the underlying MonngoDB.

Once this is done, you can rename the field in the Prisma API. Adjust the datamodel to look as follows:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  lastName: String!
```

Finally, run `prisma deploy`. 

> Note that the Prisma CLI might require you to run `prisma deploy --force` to execute this operation. This is a bug in the CLI that has been reported [here](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3871).

### Deleting a collection

Assume you have the following datamodel:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```
 
Now you want to remove the `Post` type from the Prisma API and drop the `Post` collection in the underlying MongoDB.

You first need to remove the `Post` from the datamodel:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
}
```

Now run `prisma deploy` to apply the changes. This does not change anything in the underlying MongoDB, the `Post` collections remains there as a _dangling collection_.

To get rid of the dangling collection, you need to [manually remove the collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.remove/) from your MongoDB database.
