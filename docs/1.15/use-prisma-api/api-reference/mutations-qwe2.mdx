## Overview

### How are mutations in the Prisma API generated?

The GraphQL API of a Prisma service is specified in the Prisma GraphQL schema. The Prisma GraphQL schema is auto-generated based on the service's data model:

The `Mutation` type of the Prisma GraphQL schema defines all the mutations the Prisma API accepts.

As an example, consider the following data model:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  name: String!
}
```

This is the `Mutation` type Prisma will generate:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createUser(data: UserCreateInput!): User!
  updateUser(data: UserUpdateInput!, where: UserWhereUniqueInput!): User
  deleteUser(where: UserWhereUniqueInput!): User
  upsertUser(where: UserWhereUniqueInput!, create: UserCreateInput!, update: UserUpdateInput!): User!
  updateManyUsers(data: UserUpdateInput!, where: UserWhereInput!): BatchPayload!
  deleteManyUsers(where: UserWhereInput!): BatchPayload!
}
```

For every type in your data model, six mutation are generated. Taking above the above `User` type as an example, these mutations are:

- `createUser`: Create a new `User` node
- `updateUser`: Update an existing `User` node
- `deleteUser`: Delete an existing `User` node
- `upsertUser`: Update an existing `User` node; if it does not exist create a new `User` node
- `updateManyUsers`: Update many `User` nodes at once
- `deleteManyUsers`: Delete many `User` nodes at once

To inspect all the available operations of your Prisma API in detail, you can read the Prisma GraphQL schema of your Prisma service. It can be downloaded with the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli):

```bash
graphql get-schema --endpoint __YOUR_PRISMA_ENDPOINT__ --output prisma.graphql --no-all
```

Another way to learn about the concrete capabilities of your Prisma API is by exploring the auto-generated API documentation inside a GraphQL Playground. You can do so by clicking the green **SCHEMA**-button at the right edge of the Playground:

### Data model for examples on this page

All example mutations on this page are based on a Prisma service configured with this data model:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  title: String!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
  author: User
}

type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  age: Int
  email: String! @unique
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}
```


## Mutation concepts

The Prisma API offers three kinds of mutations:

- **Object mutations**: Create, update, upsert or delete a single node of a certain [object type](knul#object-types).
- **Nested mutations**: Create, update, upsert, delete, connect, disconnect multiple nodes of two or more related types.
- **Batch mutations**: Update and delete many nodes of a certain [object type](knul#object-types).

When working with the Prisma API, the following concepts are also useful to keep in mind:

- **Relation mutations**: Connect and disconnect two nodes in a relation (this is done via nested mutations).
- **Input types**: The Prisma API follows best practices of GraphQL mutation design and accepts mutation arguments as a single input object called `data`.

## Object mutations

You can use **object mutations** to modify single nodes of a certain model.

### Creating nodes

You can create new nodes using `create` mutations. These mutations take one input object called `data` wrapping all _required_ fields of the respective type.

**Create a new `User` node:**

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(
    data: {
      age: 42
      email: "alice@prisma.io"
      name: "Alice"
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

### Updating nodes

You can change the values of one or more fields of a node using an `update` mutation. The node to be updated is [selected](vw4d#node-selection) using the `where` argument and the new values are provided via the `data` argument. Nodes can be selected by any field that's annotated with the `@unique` directive.

**Change the `name` of a `User` node identified by its `id`:**

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    data: {
      name: "Alice"
    }
    where: {
      id: "cjcdi63j80adw0146z7r59bn5"
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

**Change the `name` of a `User` node identified by its `email`:**

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    data: {
      name: "Alice"
    }
    where: {
      email: "alice@prisma.io"
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

### Upserting nodes

When you want to either update an existing node, _or_ create a new one in a single mutation, you can use _upsert_ mutations.

**Update the `User` with a certain `email`, or create a new `User` if a `User` with that `email` doesn't exist yet**:

```graphql
mutation {
  upsertUser(
    where: {
      email: "alice@prisma.io"
    }
    create: {
      email: "alice@prisma.io"
      age: 42
      name: "Alice"
    }
    update: {
      age: 42
    }
  ) {
    name
  }
}
```

### Deleting nodes

To delete nodes, you need to [select the node](vw4d#node-selection) to be deleted via the `where` argument in a `delete` mutation.

**Delete a `User` node by its `id`:**

```graphql
mutation {
  deleteUser(where: {
    id: "cjcdi63l20adx0146vg20j1ck"
  }) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

**Delete a `User` node by its `email`:**

```graphql
mutation {
  deleteUser(where: {
    email: "cjcdi63l20adx0146vg20j1ck"
  }) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

## Nested mutations

You can use `create` and `update` mutations to modify nodes across relations at the same time. This is referred to as **nested mutations** and is executed [transactionally](vw4d#transactions--nested-mutations).

Several nested mutation arguments exist:

- `create`
- `update`
- `upsert`
- `delete`
- `connect`
- `disconnect`

Rather than mapping out all possible scenarios at this point, we provide a list of examples.

It's recommended to explore the behaviour of different nested mutations by using the [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground).

### Creating and connecting related nodes

You can use the `connect` mutation within a nested input object field to connect to one or more related nodes.

**Create a new `Post` node and connect it to an existing `User` node via the unique `email` field:**

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(data: {
    title: "This is a draft"
    author: {
      connect: {
        email: "alice@prisma.io"
      }
    }
  }) {
    id
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

If you provide a `create` argument instead of `connect` within `author`, you would _create_ a new `User` node and at the same time connect the new `Post` node to it:

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(data: {
    title: "This is a draft"
    author: {
      create: {
        name: "Bob"
        email: "bob@prisma.io"
        age: 42
      }
    }
  }) {
    id
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

When using the `createUser` instead of a `createPost` mutation, you can actually create and connect to multiple `Post` nodes at the same time, because `User` has a _to-many_ relation `Post`.

**Create a new `User` node and directly connect it to several newly created `Post` nodes:**

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(
    data: {
      name: "Bob"
      email: "bob@prisma.io"
      age: 42
      posts: {
        create: [
          {
            published: true
            title: "Hello World"
          },
          {
            title: "GraphQL is great"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    posts {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

**Create a new `User` node and directly connect it to several newly created _and_ existing `Post` nodes:**

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(
    data: {
      name: "Bob"
      email: "bob@prisma.io"
      age: 42
      posts: {
        create: [
          {
            published: true
            title: "Hello World"
          },
          {
            title: "GraphQL is great"
          }
        ]
        connect: [
          {
            id: "cjcdi63j80adw0146z7r59bn5"
          }, {
            id: "cjcdi63l80ady014658ud1u02"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    posts {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Updating and upserting related nodes

When updating nodes, you can update one or more related nodes at the same time.

**Update the `title` of a `Post` node that belongs to a certain `User` node:**

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    data: {
      posts: {
        update: [
          {
            where: {
              id: "cjcf1cj0r017z014605713ym0"
            }
            data: {
              title: "Hello World"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    where: {
      id: "cjcf1cj0c017y01461c6enbfe"
    }
  ) {
    id
    posts {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

`update` accepts a list of objects with `where` and `data` fields suitable for the `updatePost` mutation.

**Update the `name` of an existing `User` node _or_ create a new `User` node that belongs to a certain `Post` node:**

Nested upserting works similarly:

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(
    where: {
      id: "cjcf1cj0r017z014605713ym0"
    }
    data: {
      author: {
        upsert: {
          where: {
            id: "cjcf1cj0c017y01461c6enbfe"
          }
          update: {
            id: "cjcdi63l80ady014658ud1u02"
            name: "Alice"
          }
          create: {
            email: "alice@prisma.io"
            name: "Alice"
            age: 42
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    author {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

**Disconnecting a `Post` node from a `User` node**:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    where: {
      id: "cjcf1cj0c017y01461c6enbfe"
    }
    data: {
      posts: {
        disconnect: [
          { id: "cjcdi63l80ady014658ud1u02" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
    posts {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

### Deleting related nodes

When updating nodes, you can delete one or more related nodes at the same time.

**Delete `Post` nodes belonging to a certain `User` node:**

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    data: {
      posts: {
        delete: [
          {
            id: "cjcf1cj0u01800146jii8h8ch"
          },
          {
            id: "cjcf1cj0u01810146m84cnt34"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    where: {
      id: "cjcf1cj0c017y01461c6enbfe"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```


## Scalar list mutations

When an [object type](knul#object-types) has a field that is has a _scalar list_ as its type, there are a number of special mutations available.

In the following data model, the `User` type has three such fields:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  scores: [Int!]!         # scalar list for integers
  friends: [String!]!     # scalar list for strings
  coinFlips: [Boolean!]!  # scalar list for booleans
}
```

### Creating nodes

When creating a new node of type `User`, a list of values can be provided for each scalar list field using `set`.

**Create a new `User` and set the values for `scores`, `friends` and `coinFlips`:**

```grahpql
mutation {
  createUser(data: {
    scores: { set: [1, 2, 3] }
    friends: { set: ["Sarah", "Jane"] }
    throws: { set: [false, false] }
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

### Updating nodes

When updating an existing node of type `User`, a number of additional operations can be performed on the scalar list fields (such as `scores: [Int!]!`):

- `set`: Override the existing list with an entirely new list.
- `push` (coming soon): Add one or more elements anywhere in the list.
- `pop` (coming soon): Remove one or more elements from the beginning or the end of the list.
- `remove` (coming soon): Remove all elements from the list that match a given filter.

> `push`, `pop` and `remove` are not yet implemented. If you're curios what these are going to look like, you can get a preview in the respective [specification](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1275).

Each scalar list field takes an object with a `set` field in an `update` mutation. The value of that field is a single value _or_ a list of the corresponding scalar type.

**Set the `scores` of an existing `User` node to `[1]`:**

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    where: {
      id: "cjd4lfdyww0h00144zst9alur"
    }
    data: {
      scores: {
        set: 1
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

**Set the `scores` of an existing `User` node to `[10,20,30]`:**

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    where: {
      id: "cjd4lfdyww0h00144zst9alur"
    }
    data: {
      scores: {
        set: [10,20,30]
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```


## Batch Mutations

Batch mutations are useful to update or delete many nodes at once. The returned data only contains the `count` of affected nodes.

<Warning>

Batch mutations are **not** triggering [subscription](qwe3) events!

</Warning>

For updating many nodes, you can [select the affected nodes](vw4d#node-selection) using the `where` argument, while you specify the new values with `data`. All nodes will be updated to the same value.


**Set the `published` fields of all unpublished `Post` nodes that were created in 2017 to `true`:**

```graphql
mutation {
  updateManyPosts(
    where: {
      createdAt_gte: "2017"
      createdAt_lt: "2018"
      published: false
    }
    data: {
      published: true
    }
  ) {
    count
  }
}
```

**Delete all unpublished `Post` nodes where the `name` of the `author` is `Alice`:**

```graphql
mutation {
  deleteManyPosts(
    where: {
      published: false
      author: {
        name: "Alice"
      }
    }
  ) {
    count
  }
}
```
