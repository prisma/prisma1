### Usage

```sh
prisma1 introspect
```

### Examples

**Introspect an existing database**

```sh
prisma1 introspect
```

Here is a sample interaction where the PostgreSQL database connection details are provided through the wizard:

```
? What kind of database do you want to introspect? Postgres
? Enter database host localhost
? Enter database port 5432
? Enter database user prisma
? Enter database password ****
? Enter name of existing database prisma-db
? Enter name of existing schema public

Introspecting database 402ms
Created datamodel mapping based on 7 database tables.

Created 1 new file:               

  datamodel-[TIMESTAMP].graphql    GraphQL SDL-based datamodel (derived from existing database)
```

The generated datamodel file will contain a timestamp in its name to avoid overriding your existing `datamodel.prisma` file.
