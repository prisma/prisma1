## FAQ

The [Heroku integration](https://www.prisma.io/blog/heroku-integration-homihof6eifi) in Prisma Cloud can be used to quickly spin up a [Prisma server](/prisma-server) through the [Prisma Cloud Console](https://app.prisma.io/). When using the Heroku integration for that, the [Management API secret](kke4#management-api-secret) is auto-generated by Prisma Cloud. 

You can reveal the secret in your [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/):

1. In your [personal application overview](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), select the Heroku instance what was deployed through Prisma Cloud and runs the Prisma server.
1. Click on **Settings**.
1. Click on **Reveal Config Vars**.
1. Change value of the `managementApiSecret` property in the `CONFIG` variable.
