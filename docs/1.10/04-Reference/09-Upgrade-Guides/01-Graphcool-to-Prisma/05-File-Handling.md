# File Handling

Prisma doesn't provide a dedicated API for file handling. This gives you more flexibility and allows to manage files in a way that's appropriate to your application.

To learn what a file handling API based on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) can look like, check out this [example](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma/tree/master/examples/archive/file-handling-s3) project.
