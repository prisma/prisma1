## Overview

If your [Prisma server](/prisma-sever/) is configured to allow database migrations, you can use SDL to define and migrate your database schema.

Prisma uses [temporary directives](knul#temporary-directives) to perform one-time migration operations. After deploying a service that contain a temporary directive, **a temporary directive needs to be manually removed from the type definitions file**.

## Renaming

The temporary directive `@rename(oldName: String!)` is used to rename types and field.

<Warning>

If the `@rename` directive is not used, Prisma removes the old type and field before creating the new one, resulting in loss of data!

</Warning>

### Renaming types

**Renaming the `Post` type to `Story`**

```graphql
type Story @rename(oldName: "Post") {
  content: String
}
```

The `@rename(oldName: "Post")` directive needs to be deleted manually after `prisma1 deploy` was executed and the renaming was performed.

### Renaming fields

**Renaming the `text` field to `content`**

```graphql
type Story {
  content: String @rename(oldName: "text")
}
```

The `@rename(oldName: "text")` directive needs to be deleted manually after `prisma1 deploy` was executed and the renaming was performed.
