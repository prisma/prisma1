## Goals

On this page, you will learn how to:

- Define a GraphQL schema for your GraphQL server
- Implement resolver functions using the Prisma client
- Use the GraphQL Playground to try out your GraphQL API

## Configure Project

[`grahpql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) is a GraphQL server library based on [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). Add it to your project with the following command:

```bash copy
npm install --save graphql-yoga
```

## Define GraphQL API

Every GraphQL API is based on a [GraphQL schema](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e/) that specifies all API operations and data structures. The schema is as a _contract_ between client and server.

Create a new file called `schema.graphql`:

```bash copy
touch schema.graphql
```

To define the API operations, you need to specify the `Query` and `Mutation` types in your GraphQL schema - the following operations are examples for a simple blogging application:

```graphql copy
type Query {
  publishedPosts: [Post!]!
  post(postId: ID!): Post
  postsByUser(userId: ID!): [Post!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!): User
  createDraft(title: String!, userId: ID!): Post
  publish(postId: ID!): Post
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  published: Boolean!
  author: User
}
```

> The `Post` and `User` types are straightforward re-definitions of the models specified in `datamodel.prisma`, except that the Prisma-specific directives have been removed.

## Implement resolver functions

Here is how you implement the resolver functions for the six API operations defined in the GraphQL schema. Replace the current contents of `index.ts` entirely with the following code snippet:

```js lineNumbers,copy
import { prisma } from './generated/prisma-client'
import { GraphQLServer } from 'graphql-yoga'

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    publishedPosts(parent, args, context) {
      return context.prisma.posts({ where: { published: true } })
    },
    post(parent, args, context) {
      return context.prisma.post({ id: args.postId })
    },
    postsByUser(parent, args, context) {
      return context.prisma.user({
        id: args.userId
      }).posts()
    }
  },
  Mutation: {
    createDraft(parent, args, context) {
      return context.prisma.createPost(
        {
          title: args.title,
          author: {
            connect: { id: args.userId }
          }
        },

      )
    },
    publish(parent, args, context) {
      return context.prisma.updatePost(
        {
          where: { id: args.postId },
          data: { published: true },
        },

      )
    },
    createUser(parent, args, context) {
      return context.prisma.createUser(
        { name: args.name },
      )
    }
  },
  User: {
    posts(parent, args, context) {
      return context.prisma.user({
        id: parent.id
      }).posts()
    }
  },
  Post: {
    author(parent, args, context) {
      return context.prisma.post({
        id: parent.id
      }).author()
    }
  }
}
```

Each resolver invokes a method on the Prisma client instance which is called `prisma` and attached to the `context` object.

<Info>

One of the core benefits of GraphQL is its _strongly typed_ schema. To leverage the full power of the schema, you should ensure that your resolvers are entirely type-safe as well. Check out [`graphqlgen`](https://github.com/prisma/graphqlgen), a code-generation tool that helps you build type-safe GraphQL servers.

</Info>

## Configure your GraphQL server

Now you need to instantiate the `GraphQLServer` from the `graphql-yoga` library and pass the GraphQL schema along with its resolver functions. You're also attaching the imported `prisma` client instance to the `context` so that the resolvers can access it.

Add the following code snippet to the bottom of `index.ts`:

```js lineNumbers,copy
const server = new GraphQLServer({
  typeDefs: './schema.graphql',
  resolvers,
  context: {
    prisma
  },
})
server.start(() => console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000'))
```

## Start the GraphQL server

To start the GraphQL server, run the following command:

```bash copy
npm run start
```

## Explore the GraphQL API of the application layer in a Playground

The GraphQL API of your application layer now exposes the six operations defined in `schema.graphql`.

To test these operations, navigate your browser to `http://localhost:4000` where a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) is running.

<Collapse title="Learn more about the GraphQL Playground">

A GraphQL Playground is an interactive GraphQL IDE that lets you explore the operations of GraphQL API. You can click the green **SCHEMA**-button at the right edge of the Playground window to view the auto-generated documentation for your GraphQL API.

Here are a few sample queries and mutations you can send to explore the API.

<QueryChooser titles={["Create a new User", "Create new draft", "Publish a Post", "Fetch published Posts"]}>

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
mutation {
  createUser(name: "Jane") {
    id
  }
}
```

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
mutation {
  createDraft(
    title: "GraphQL is great"
    userId: "__USER_ID__"
  ) {
    id
    published
    author {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
mutation {
  publish(postId: "__POST_ID__") {
    id
    title
    published
  }
}
```

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
query {
  publishedPosts {
    id
    title
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

</QueryChooser>

> In some snippets, you need to replace the `__USER__ID__` or `__POST_ID__` placeholder with the ID of an actual user or post.
