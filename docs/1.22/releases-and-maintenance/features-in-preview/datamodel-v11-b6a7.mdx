<Info>

We are currently working on a [new version of the Prisma datamodel](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3408) with many great improvements.

The new datamodel is currently in [Preview](oje2#preview-vs-final) and can be used with the [MongoDB connector](b6o5). This means its API is considered stable but there might be significant internal improvements while it's still in Preview.
