}

## Main components

When working with Prisma, you're primarily dealing with **three components**:

The **datamodel** is the foundation for everything you do with Prisma. It determines the API exposed by your auto-generated **Prisma client**. You also need to have a **Prisma server** which is a standalone infrastructure component sitting on top of your database. 

## Datamodel

The datamodel primarily serves as foundation for the API operations of your Prisma client.

### Prisma client operations derived from datamodel

For each model defined in your datamodel, there are the following Prisma client operations automatically generated for you:

- **Read a single record** of the model
- **Read a list of records** of the model (including filtering, sorting & pagination)
- **Write a new record** of the model
- **Update an existing record** of the model
- **Delete an existing record** of the model 
- **Check for the existence** of a certain record of the model
- **Receive realtime updates** when there is a write operation on any record of the model

### The Schema Definition Language

The datamodel is written in `.prisma`-files and uses [GraphQL SDL syntax](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51/). SDL is used because it is _agnostic of programming languages_, _simple_, _expressive_ and _intuitive_ to use.

There is no hard technical requirement for using SDL to define the datamodel and the API might be openened up to specify the datamodel in other ways in the future. Please create a [feature request](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) if you'd like to see a different way for specifying the datamodel.

### Using the datamodel for database migrations (optional)

There are two cases how the datamodel can be created:

- **Manually specified**: When the datamodel is written manually from scratch, the datamodel is also used to perform database migrations (this only applies for _new_ databases without existing data). The model definitions of the datamodel not only determine the API operations of the Prisma client, but are also mapped to the database (meaning they're used to perform database migrations in a declarative way).
- **Derived from an existing database schema (introspection)**: When you're starting to use Prisma with an existing database, the datamodel is derived from the existing database schema. In this case, Prisma is not used to perform database migrations (instead, you keep migrating the database manually as you used too).

> While there currently is a clear rule for when you can use Prisma to perform database migrations and when not, it is planned to unify the two approaches. This means you'll always have the flexibility to perform migrations manually or use Prisma for that. [Learn more](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/3022).

### Example

Here is what a simple datamodel with two models looks like:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  createdAt: DateTime!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
  title: String!
  author: User!
}

type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  email: String @unique
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}
```

Here's a few things to note about the datamodel:

- The `Post` and `User` models are connected via a relation (defined by the `author` and `posts` fields).
- The `!` following a type means that the corresponding field of the model can never be `null`.
- The `@unique` directive is used by Prisma to ensure there'll never be two records that have the same value for this field.
- The `@default` directive is used by Prisma to set default values when records of this model are being created.
- `createdAt` is not writeable and will be maintained by Prisma, it indicates the exact time when a record was created. There also is `updatedAt` which indicates the time when a record was last updated.


## Prisma client

The Prisma client is an auto-generated library that replaces a traditional ORM in your API server. It connects to a Prisma server which sits on top your database:

### Seamless relations API

The Prisma client is available in various programming languages and provides type safe database access. In contrast to traditional ORMs, it provides a seamless API to work with relational data, JOINs and transactions.

Here is an example that performs several write operations in a single transaction:

- Create a new `User` record
- Create two new `Post` records
- Connect the two newly created and one existing `Post` record to the new `User` record via the `posts` relation

<Code languages={["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Go"]}>

```js
const newUserWithLinks = await prisma
  .createUser({
    name: "Alice",
    password: "IlikeTurtles",
    posts: {
      create: [{
        title: "Prisma is the data layer for modern applications",
      }, {
        title: "Check out How to GraphQL - The fullstack tutorial for GraphQL",
      }],
      connect: {
        id: "cjli6tknz005s0a23uf0lmlve"
      }
    }, 
  })
```

```ts
const newUserWithLinks: UserNode = await prisma
  .createUser({
    name: "Alice",
    password: "IlikeTurtles",
    links: {
      create: [{
        description: "The data layer for modern applications",
        url: "https://www.prisma.io"
      }, {
        description: "Fullstack GraphQL tutorial",
        url: "https://www.howtographql.com"
      }],
      connect: {
        id: "cjli6tknz005s0a23uf0lmlve"
      }
    }, 
  })
```

```go
name := "Alice"
    password := "IlikeTurtles"

    description := "The data layer for modern applications"
    url := "https://www.prisma.io"

    linkId := "cjli6tknz005s0a23uf0lmlve"

    db.CreateUser(&prisma.UserCreateInput{
        Name:     &name,
        Password: &password,
        Links: &prisma.LinkCreateManyWithoutPostedByInput{
            Create: &prisma.LinkCreateWithoutPostedByInput{
                Description: &description,
                Url:         &url,
            },
            Connect: &prisma.LinkWhereUniqueInput{
                ID: &linkId,
            },
        },
    })
```

</Code>

For traditional ORMs, such a set of write operations requires you to manually control a database transaction. Prisma client handles the transaction for you.

### Type safe database access

The operations exposed by your Prisma client are strongly typed. For any typed programming language, this means that you get _compile-time safety_ for all database operations and you know _exactly_ what shape of data is going to be returned.

It also makes for an amazing developer experience where you get _auto-completion_ in your editor.

All the typings are auto-generated, so you don't need to deal with writing any boilerplate for that. After you changed your datamodel, you just regenerate your Prisma client and all typings will be updated.

### Realtime updates

Adding a realtime event system to your database is an extremely complicated task. Prisma client lets you subsribe to any database event without having to deal with the underlying infrastructure. You can do so via generated methods on the `$subscribe` property.

Here is an example that subscribes to events where new `User` records are created that have `gmail` in their email address:

<Code languages={["JavsScript", "TypeScript"]}>

```js
prisma.$subsribe.user({
  mutation_in: ["CREATED"],
  email_contains: "gmail"
})
```


```ts
prisma.$subsribe.user({
  mutation_in: ["CREATED"],
  email_contains: "gmail"
})
```

</Code>

### Native GraphQL

The Prisma client lets you run GraphQL queries and mutations against your database using the `$graphql` method.

Here is an example that shows how to create a new `User` record using the native GraphQL API:

<Code languages={["JavsScript", "TypeScript"]}>

```js
const mutation = `
  mutation ($name: String!){
    createUser(name: $name) {
      id
    }
  }
`

const variables = { name: 'Alice' }
const result = prisma.$graphql(mutation, variables)
```

```ts
const mutation = `
  mutation ($name: String!){
    createUser(name: $name) {
      id
    }
  }
`

const variables: UserCreateInput = { name: 'Alice' }
const result: any = prisma.$graphql(mutation, variables)
```

</Code>
