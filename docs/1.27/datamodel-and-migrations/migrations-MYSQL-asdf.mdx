## Overview

When using Prisma with a MySQL database, _all_ your database migrations are performed using the [`prisma1 deploy`](xcv9) command of the Prisma CLI.

## Database migrations with Prisma

There are two steps to every database migration:

1. Adjust the [datamodel](knul) file to reflect the new desired schema
1. Run `prisma1 deploy` to apply the changes and perform the migration of the underlying database

### Migration operations

Prisma uses [temporary directives](knul#temporary-directives) to perform one-time migration operations. After deploying a service that contain a temporary directive, **a temporary directive needs to be manually removed from the type definitions file**.

#### Renaming

The temporary directive `@rename(oldName: String!)` is used to rename a _type_ or a _field of a type_.

<Warning>

If the `@rename` directive is not used, Prisma deletes old type/field before creating the new one, resulting in loss of data!

</Warning>

**Renaming a type**

Here is an example scenario:

##### 1) Before migration

```graphql
type Post {
  text: String
}
```

##### 2) Goal

Rename the `Post` type to `Story`

##### 3) Adding the `@rename` directive

```graphql
# renaming the `Post` type to `Story`
type Story @rename(oldName: "Post") {
  text: String
}
```

##### 4) Migrating the database with `prisma1 deploy`

After having the saved the datamodel file with these changes, you need to run:

```
prisma1 deploy
```

##### 5) Removing the `@rename` directive manually

```graphql
type Story {
  text: String
}
```

**Renaming a field**

Here is an example scenario:

##### 1) Before migration

```graphql
type Post {
  text: String
}
```

##### 2) Goal

Rename the `text` field to `content`

##### 3) Adding the `@rename` directive

```graphql
# renaming the `text` field to `content`
type Post {
  content: String @rename(oldName: "text")
}
```

##### 4) Migrating the database with `prisma1 deploy`

After having the saved the datamodel file with these changes, you need to run:

```
prisma1 deploy
```

##### 5) Removing the `@rename` directive manually

```graphql
type Post {
  content: String
}
```

### Limitations

- It is currently not possible to rename relations that are specified via the `@relation` directive.
