## Overview

The `Prisma` constructor is used to create new instances of the Prisma client.

```js
constructor(options: BasePrismaOptions)
```

`BasePrismaOptions` has the following properties (all are optional):

- `endpoint: string`: The endpoint of your Prisma service. If not provided, the Client will default to the `endpoint` that was specified in prisma.yml when the Client was generated. 
- `secret: string`: The secret protecting the API of your Prisma service. If not provided, the Client will default to the `secret` that was specified in prisma.yml when the Client was generated. 
- `debug: boolean`: If set to `true`, each invokation of a method on the Prisma client will print the GraphQL query that is sent to the Prisma API to the console. **Default: `false`**.
- `fragmentReplacements: FragmentReplacement[]`: A list of GraphQL fragments that will be applied to each query/mutation/subscription sent to the Prisma API.

### Examples

_Use default values for `endpoint` and `secret` that were specified in prisma.yml when the Client was generated_:

```js
const prisma = new Prisma({})
```

_Override default values for `endpoint` and `secret` that had been specified in prisma.yml when the Client was generated_:

```js
const prisma = new Prisma({ 
  endpoint: "http://localhost:4466/hello-world/dev",
  secret: "mysecret42",
})
```
