## Overview

The [1.8 release](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma/releases/tag/1.8.0) introduces a couple of changes surrounding deployment and setting up and managing Prisma servers.

## Changes to the Management API

The Management API of a Prisma server is responsible for service deployment and also provides information about the Prisma server.

Previously, the Management API was available at `/cluster`, for example `localhost:4466/cluster`.
With 1.8, `/cluster` is not available anymore. The endpoint has been updated to `/management`, for example `localhost:4466/management`.

The Management API exposes a GraphQL API, that previously contained a top-level field `clusterInfo`. It has been renamed to `serverInfo` in 1.8. `clusterInfo` is deprecated and will be removed in version 1.10.

## Changes to the management database

A Prisma server stores information about services and service migrations in a dedicated management schema in the connected database. Previously, this schema was called `graphcool`. In 1.8, `management` is used by default instead. Using the `managementSchema` setting in the Prisma server configuration allows you to use a different database. For the PostgreSQL connector, both the `database` and the `managementSchema` setting can be adjusted.

Using MySQL:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.8
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: mysql
            host: https://example.com
            port: 3306
            user: root
            password: prisma
            managementSchema: graphcool # default: management
```

Using PostgreSQL:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.8
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: postgres
            host: https://example.com
            port: 5432
            user: root
            password: prisma
            database: graphcool # default: prisma
            managementSchema: graphcool # default: management
```

## A new migrations setting

In anticipation of connectors with disabled migrations, a new connector setting `migrations` is available:


```yml
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.8
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: postgres
            host: https://example.com
            port: 5432
            user: root
            password: prisma
            migrations: false # default: true
```

The setting `migrations: false` is typically used with existing databases that come with a preconfigured database schema and existing data. This is usually used in combination with the new introspection feature.

With 1.8, we are introducing preliminary alpha support for the PostgreSQL connector to connect to existing databases. The same will be possible with the MySQL connector further down the road.
