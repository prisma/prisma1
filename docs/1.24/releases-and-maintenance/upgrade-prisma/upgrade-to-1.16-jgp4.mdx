## Overview

Prisma 1.16 introduces a number of non-breaking changes.

## Changing the suffix of datamodel files

The suffix of datamodel files is changed to `.prisma` instead of `.graphql`. This is backwards compatible, so `.graphql` will continue to work.

## Introducing Prisma client

Prisma client is an auto-generated library that can be used to consume a Prisma API.

### Generating a Prisma client

To generate a Prisma client, you need to add the [`generate`](5cy7#generate-optional) property to your prisma.yml:

The `generate` property is used to specify how and where a Prisma client (or other files) should be generated.

The following generators are built-into the Prisma CLI:

- Prisma client in JavaScript: `javascript-client`
- Prisma client in TypeScript: `typescript-client`
- Prisma client in Flow: `flow-client`
- Prisma client in Go: `go-client`
- GraphQL schema of the Prisma API: `graphql-schema`

The `generate` property expects a **list of objects**. There are two properties on these objects:

- `generator`: One of the available generators from the list above.
- `output`: Specifies where the generated files should be located.

Here is an example that generates the Prisma client in JavaScript and the GraphQL schema of the Prisma API:

```yml
generate:
    - generator: javascript-client
      output: ./generated/prisma
    - generator: graphql-schema
      output: ./generated/prisma
```
