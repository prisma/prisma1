## Overview

prisma.yml is the _root configuration file_ for a  Prisma service. Every Prisma service is defined by exactly one prisma.yml. You can think of prisma.yml as a _template_ for one Prisma service.

prisma.yml specifies a number of properties about the Prisma service, e.g.:

- the service's _endpoint_ (includes _name_ and _stage_ of the service)
- the _database type_ (relational or document database)
- how and where the Prisma client should be generated
- the _service secret_ used to authenticate requests made to the service's API
- the location of the _data model_ file(s)
- _hooks_ that specify shell commands to be executed at some point in the _deployment process_

## Examples

### Minimal example

The most minimal version of a valid prisma.yml needs to contains at least two properties:

- `datamodel`
- `endpoint`

To be able to specify an `endpoint`, you need to have access to a Prisma server. If you don't have access to a Prisma server, you can omit the `endpoint` from prisma.yml and run `prisma1 deploy` only with the `datamodel` property. In that case, a CLI wizard guides you through the process of creating a local Prisma server or lets you deploy to a [Demo server](jfr3) in Prisma Cloud. It then writes the `endpoint` into prisma.yml for you before the service gets deployed:

```yml
datamodel: datamodel.prisma
```

> In this example, the `databaseType` is inferred and defaults to `relational`.

### Standard example

The most commonly used properties in prisma.yml are:

- `datamodel`
- `endpoint`
- `secret`
- `hooks`
- `generate`


Here's what a standard prisma.yml with these properties might look like:

```yml
datamodel: datamodel.prisma
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/myservice/dev
secret: mysecret42

generate:
    - generator: javascript-client
      output: ./generated/prisma

hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - prisma generate
```

> In this example, the `databaseType` is inferred and defaults to `relational`.

### Exhaustive example

Here's an example where all properties of prisma.yml are being used:

```yml
# This service is based on the type definitions in the two files
# databasetypes.graphql` and `database/enums.graphql`
datamodel:
  - database/types.prisma
  - database/enums.prisma

# The endpoint represents the HTTP endpoint for your Prisma API.
# It encodes several pieces of information:
# * Prisma server (`localhost:4466` in this example)
# * Service name (`myservice` in this example)
# * Stage (`dev` in this example)
# NOTE: When service name and stage are set to `default`, they
# can be omitted.
# Meaning http://myserver.com/default/default can be written
# as http://myserver.com.
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/myservice/dev

# The secret is used to create JSON web tokens (JWTs). These
# tokens need to be attached in the `Authorization` header
# of HTTP requests made against the Prisma endpoint.
# WARNING: If the secret is not provided, the Prisma API can
# be accessed without authentication!
secret: mysecret123

# Generate a Prisma client in JavaScript and store in
# a folder called `generated/prisma-client`.
# It also downloads the Prisma GraphQL schema and stores it
# in `generated/prisma.graphql`.
generate:
    - generator: javascript-client
      output: ./generated/prisma-client
    - generator: graphql-schema
      output: ./generated/

# A "post-deployment" hook that regenerates
# the Prisma client.
hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - prisma generate

# Points to a `.graphql` file containing GraphQL
# operations that will be executed when initially
# deploying a service.
seed:
  import: database/seed.graphql
```

> In this example, the `databaseType` is inferred and defaults to `relational`.

This prisma.yml expects the following file structure:

```
.
├── prisma.yml
└── database
    ├── types.graphql
    └── enums.graphql
```


## Using variables

Variables allow you to dynamically replace configuration values in your prisma.yml. They are especially useful when providing _secrets_ for your service and when you have a multi-staging developer workflows.

To use variables inside prisma.yml, you need to reference the values enclosed in `${}` brackets:

```yml
yamlKeyXYZ: ${variableSource}
```

A _variable source_ can be either of the following two options:

- A _recursive self-reference_ to another value inside the same service (often used in combination with the `custom` property)
- An _environment variable_

> You can only use variables in property **values** - not in property keys. So you can't use variables to e.g. generate dynamic logical IDs in the custom resources section for example.

### Recursive self-reference

You can recursively reference other property values that live inside the same prisma.yml file.

When using a recursive self-reference as a variable, the value that you put into the bracket is composed of:

- the _prefix_ `self:`
- (optional) the _path_ to the referenced property; if no path is specified, the value of the variable will be the entire YAML file.

```yml
datamodel: ${self:custom.datamodelPath}.prisma

custom:
  datamodelPath: myDatamodel
```

> This works for any property inside prisma.yml, not just `custom`.

### Environment variable

You can reference [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) inside the service definition file.

When using an environment variable, the value that you put into the bracket is composed of:

- the _prefix_ `env:`
- the _name_ of the environment variable

In the following example, an environment variable is referenced to determine the Prisma service secret:

```yml
secret: ${env:PRISMA_SECRET}
```

## Reference

### Root properties

The service definition file prisma.yml has the following root properties:

- `datamodel` (required): Type definitions for database models, relations, enums and other types.
- `endpoint`: HTTP endpoint for the Prisma API. Can be omitted to prompt CLI deployment wizard.
- `secret`: Service secret for securing the API endpoint.
- `generate`: The list of files (Prisma client and/or Prisma GraphQL schema) to be generated.
- `databaseType`: Specifies whether the Prisma service uses a document ro relational database.
- `hooks`: Define CLI commands to be executed before/after specific actions of the Prisma CLI.
- `seed`: Points to a file containing mutations for data seeding.
- `custom`: Used to provide variables which can be referenced elsewhere in prisma.yml.

The exact structure of prisma.yml is defined with [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/). You can find the corresponding schema definition [here](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-json-schema/blob/master/src/schema.json). The JSON schem definition also allows to elevate your tooling and let your code editors and IDEs help you with the right structure of prisma.yml.

### datamodel (required)

The `datamodel` points to one or more `.graphql`-files containing model definitions written in GraphQL SDL. If multiple files are provided, the CLI simply concatenates their contents at deployment time.

#### Type

The `datamodel` property expects a **string** or a **list of strings**.

#### Examples

The datamodel is defined in a file called `types.graphql`.

```yml
datamodel: types.graphql
```

The datamodel is defined in two files called `types.graphql` and `enums.graphl`. When the service gets deployed, the contents of both files will be concatenated by the CLI.

```yml
datamodel:
  - types.graphql
  - enums.graphql
```

### endpoint (optional)

The HTTP endpoint for your Prisma API is composed of the following components:

- **Prisma server**: The server that will host your Prisma service.
- **Workspace** (only for [Demo servers](jfr3) in Prisma Cloud): The name of the Workspace you configured through Prisma Cloud.
- **Service name**: A descriptive name for your Prisma servic e.
- **Service stage**: The development stage of your cluster (e.g. `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).

Note that the `endpoint` is actually required to deploy your Prisma service. However, if you don't specify it in prisma.yml before running `prisma1 deploy`, the CLI prompts you with a wizard to help you figure out a Prisma server as deployment target and subsequently writes the `endpoint` into prisma.yml for you.

#### Type

The `endpoint` property expects a **string**.

#### Examples

The following example endpoint encodes the following information:

- **Prisma server**: `http://localhost:4466` means you're running a Prisma server locally on your machine (e.g. using Docker).
- **Service name**: `default`
- **Stage**: `default`

> When service name and stage are both set to `default`, they can be omitted and will be inferred by Prisma. This means this example endpoint is equivalent to writing: `http://localhost:4466/`

```yml
endpoint: http://localhost:4466/default/default
```

The following example endpoint encodes the following information:

- **Prisma server**: `https://eu1.prisma.sh` means you're using a Prisma Demo server as a deployment target for your Prisma service.
- **Workspace**: `jane-doe` is the name of your Prisma Cloud workspace.
- **Service name**: `myservice`
- **Stage**: `dev`

```yml
endpoint: https://eu1.prisma.sh/jane-doe/myservice/dev
```

The following example endpoint encodes the following information:

- **Prisma server**: `http://my-pr-Publi-1GXX8QUZU3T89-413349553.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com` means you're using a Prisma server hosted on AWS to deploy your Prisma service.
- **Service name**: `cat-pictures`
- **Stage**: `prod`

```yml
endpoint: http://my-pr-Publi-1GXX8QUZU3T89-413349553.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/cat-pictures/prod
```

### secret (optional)

The service secret is used to generate (or _sign_) authentication tokens ([JWT](https://jwt.io)). One of these authentication tokens needs to be attached to the HTTP requests made against the Prisma API exposes by the service (in the `Authorization` header field).

A secret must follow these requirements:

- must be [utf8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoded
- must not contain spaces
- must be at most 256 characters long

Note that it's possible to encode multiple secrets in this string, which allows for smooth secret rotations.

<Warning>

If the Prisma service is deployed without a `secret`, its API does not require authentication. This means everyone with access to the `endpoint` is able to send queries and mutations to the API and can therefore arbitrarily read and write to the database!

</Warning>

#### Type

The `secret` property expects a **string** (not a list of strings). If you want to specify multiple secrets, you need to provide them as a comma-separated list (spaces are ignored), but still as a single string value.

#### Examples

Define one secret with value `moo4ahn3ahb4phein1eingaep`.

```yml
secret: moo4ahn3ahb4phein1eingaep
```

Define three secrets with values `myFirstSecret`, `SECRET_NUMBER_2` and `3rd-secret`. Note that the spaces before the second secret are ignored.

```yml
secret: myFirstSecret,    SECRET_NUMBER_2,3rd-secret
```

Use the value of the `MY_SECRET` environment variable as the secret(s).

```yml
secret: ${env:MY_SECRET}
```

### generate (optional)

The `generate` property is used to specify how and where a Prisma client (or other files) should be generated.

The following generators are built-into the Prisma CLI:

- Prisma client in JavaScript: `javascript-client`
- Prisma client in TypeScript: `typescript-client`
- Prisma client in Flow: `flow-client`
- Prisma client in Go: `go-client`
- GraphQL schema of the Prisma API: `graphql-schema`

#### Type

The `generate` property expects a **list of objects**. There are two properties on these objects:

- `generator`: One of the available generators from the list above.
- `output`: Specifies where the generated files should be located.

#### Examples

```yml
generate:
    - generator: javascript-client
      output: ./generated/prisma-client
    - generator: graphql-schema
      output: ./generated/prisma
```

### databaseType (optional)

#### Type

The `databaseType` property expects a **string**. The value of the string can either be `relational` or `document`. If the `databaseType` property is omitted, its value defaults to `relational`.

#### Examples

Use a document database.

```yml
databaseType: document
```

Use a document database.

```yml
databaseType: relational
```

### hooks (optional)

The `hooks` property is used to define terminal commands which will be executed by the Prisma CLI before or after certain commands.

The following hooks are currently available:

- `post-deploy`: Will be invoked _after_ the `prisma1 deploy` command

#### Type

The `hooks` property expects an **object**. The properties of that object match the names of the currently available hooks.

#### Examples

Here is an example that performs two tasks after `prisma1 deploy` was executed:

1. Print "Deployment finished"
1. Invoke code generation with `prisma generate`

```yml
hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - echo "Deployment finished"
    - prisma generate
```

### seed (optional)

Database seeding is a standardised way to populate a service with test data.

#### Type

The `seed` property expects an **object**, with either one of two sub-properties:

- `import`: Instructions to import data when seeding a service. You can refer to either of two kinds of files:
  - A path to a `.graphql` file with GraphQL operations.
  - A path to a `.zip` file that contains a data set in Normalized Data Format (NDF)
- `run`: Shell command that will be executed when seeding a service. This is meant for more complex seed setups that are not covered by `import`.

Seeds are implicitly executed when deploying a service for the first time (unless explicitly disabled using the `--no-seed` flag on `prisma1 deploy`). Track [this feature request for additional seeding workflows](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1536).

#### Examples

Refer to a `.graphql` file containing seeding mutations:

```yml
seed:
  import: database/seed.graphql
```

Refer to a `.zip` file with a data set in NDF:

```yml
seed:
  import: database/backup.zip
```

Run a Node script when seeding:

```yml
seed:
  run: node script.js
```

### custom (optional)

The `custom` property lets you specify any sorts of values you want to reuse elsewhere in your prisma.yml. It thus doesn't have a predefined structure. You can reference the values using variables with the [`self` variable source](#self-reference), e.g.: `${self:custom.myVariable}`.

#### Type

The `custom` property expects an **object**. There are no assumptions about the shape of the object.

#### Examples

Define two custom values and reuse them in the definition of the datamodel and Prisma client generators.

```yml
custom:
  language: typescript
  datamodel: myDatamodel

datamodel: ${self:custom.datamodel}.prisma

generate:
  - generator: ${self:custom.language}-client
    output: ./generated/prisma-client
```
