## Overview

The Prisma command line interface (CLI) is the primary tool to deploy and manage your Prisma services.

The Prisma CLI helps you in areas such as:

- Bootstraping service configuration files for new services
- Deploying services to Prisma _servers_
- Generating authentication tokens
- Seeding, importing and exporting data
- ...and more

To get detailled information about all CLI commands, read the [**command reference**](xcv9).

## Installation

The Prisma CLI can be installed from the [NPM registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry).

### Homebrew

```bash copy
brew install prisma
brew tap 
```

### NPM

```bash copy
npm install -g prisma
```

### Yarn

```bash copy
yarn global add prisma
```

Examples:

- Initialize files for a new Prisma service
  $ prisma init

## Quickstart

Once installed, execute the following commands to get your Prisma API up-and-running and start sending queries and mutations to it:

```bash
prisma init hello-world
# Select a *demo server* from the interactive prompt
cd hello-world
prisma deploy
prisma playground
```

You can now start sending queries and mutations to your Prisma API. For a more comprehensive walkthrough, check out the [Get Started](a001) section.

## Usage with `graphql-config`

The Prisma CLI integrates with [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-config). If your project uses a `.graphqlconfig`-file, you can use the `prisma` extension and point it to your prisma.yml:

```yml
projects:
  prisma:
    schemaPath: prisma.graphql
    extensions:
      prisma: prisma.yml
```

## Using a HTTP proxy for the CLI

The Prisma CLI supports [custom HTTP proxies](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma/issues/618). This is particularly relevant when being behind a corporate firewall.

To activate the proxy, provide the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`. The behavior is very similar to how the [`npm` CLI handles this](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#https-proxy).

The following environment variables can be provided:

- `HTTP_PROXY` or `http_proxy`: Proxy URL for http traffic, for example `http://localhost:8080`
- `HTTPS_PROXY` or `https_proxy`: Proxy URL for https traffic, for example `https://localhost:8080`
- `NO_PROXY` or `no_proxy`: To disable the proxying for certain URLs, please provide a glob for `NO_PROXY`, for example `*`.

To get a simple local proxy, you can use the [`proxy` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy):

```bash
npm install -g proxy
DEBUG="*" proxy -p 8080
HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8080 HTTPS_PROXY=https://localhost:8080 prisma deploy
```
