# Overview

A GraphQL binding is a concrete _instance_ of a GraphQL API. Instead of sending over your queries with a general purpose HTTP tool (such as `fetch` in JavaScript), GraphQL bindings provide _dedicated functions_ that mirror the operations of your GraphQL API. These functions are generated by the binding and will assemble and send queries/mutations/subscriptions for you under the hood.

GraphQL bindings effectively proxy your GraphQL schema, and make it accessible to you as methods on your newly created binding object. Read the full blog post introducing the idea of GraphQL bindings [here](https://medium.com/@graphcool/reusing-composing-graphql-apis-with-graphql-bindings-80a4aa37cff5).

## Install

```sh
yarn add graphql-binding
```

## Example

```js
const { makeExecutableSchema } = require('graphql-tools')
const { Binding } = require('graphql-binding')

const users = [
  {
    name: 'Alice',
  },
  {
    name: 'Bob',
  },
]

const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    findUser(name: String!): User
  }
  type User {
    name: String!
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    findUser: (parent, { name }) => users.find(u => u.name === name),
  },
}

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers })

const findUserBinding = new Binding({
  schema,
})

findUserBinding.findUser({ name: 'Bob' })
  .then(result => console.log(result))
```
