### How is this different from Graphcool Framework?

The Graphcool Framework is a strongly opinioated open-source solution based on GraphQL and Serverless functions, that provides an entire web server setup with a powerful GraphQL API.

Prisma is the result of many learnings and a lot of feedback from customers and the community, that focuses on the core of Graphcool Framework: the automatic mapping from your database to a GraphQL API. This enables you to take full control of your GraphQL server while still being able to benefit from an auto-generated and powerful GraphQL API.
