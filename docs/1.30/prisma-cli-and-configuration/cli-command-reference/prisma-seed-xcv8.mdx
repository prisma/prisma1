## `$ prisma seed`

Seeds the service with data. 

This command expects that the [`seed`](5cy7#seed-optional) property in `prisma.yml` is specified.

#### Usage

```sh
prisma seed [flags]
```

#### Flags

```
-e, --env-file ENV-FILE    Path to .env file to inject env vars
-r, --reset                Reset the service before seeding
```

#### Examples

If you specified the `seed` property in your `prisma.yml`, you can run the `prisma seed` command. For example:

<Code languages={["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Go"]}>

```yml
seed:
  run: node ./data/seed.js
```

```yml
seed:
  run: ts-node ./data/seed.ts
```

```yml
seed:
  run: go run ./data/seed.go
```

</Code>

All sample projects in the [`prisma-examples`](https://www.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples) repository are based on this seeding mechanism.

**Seed service with initial data**

```sh
prisma seed
```

**Seed service with initial data after deleting all of the service's data first**

```sh
prisma seed --reset
```
