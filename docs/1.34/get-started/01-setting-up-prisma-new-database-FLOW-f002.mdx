## Coming soon

This tutorial is currently being worked on and will be published soon. In the meantime, feel free to explore the corresponding [JavaScript tutorial](a002).

<Info>

Prisma 1 is currently in [maintenance mode](https://github.com/prisma/prisma1/issues/4898). We recommend to [**get started with Prisma 2**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart-typescript) instead.
