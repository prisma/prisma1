## prisma1 init

Bootstraps the service configuration for a new Prisma service. The command launches an interactive CLI wizard by default, helping you to decide where (i.e. to which Prisma server) the service should be deployed later.

If you already know the endpoint, you can pass it using the `--endpoint` flag and skip the interactive wizard.

The generated files are:

- prisma.yml
- datamodel.prisma
- docker-compose.yml (optional)

If you provide a directory name as an argument to the command, the generated files will be placed inside a new directory with that name.


### Flags

```bash
-e, --endpoint         The endpoint to be written into prisma.yml
```

### Usage

```bash
prisma1 init DIRNAME
```

### Examples

**Create service configuration for Prisma service in a directory called `myapp` using the wizard**

```bash
prisma1 init myapp
```


**Skip wizard and create service configuration for Prisma service in a directory called `myapp`**

```bash
prisma1 init myapp --endpoint http://localhost:4466/myapp/dev
```

## prisma1 deploy

Deploys a service configuration to a Prisma service. 

Every time you're changing a file deom your service configuration, you need to synchronize these changes with the running Prisma service.

Upon the very first deploy of a service, the command will perform initial data seeding if the `seed` property in prisma.yml is provided. You can prevent this by passing the `--no-seed` option.

If no [`endpoint`](5cy7#endpoint-optional) property is specifed in prisma.yml, the command will prompt you to interactively select a Prisma server as a deployment target for the service. After you selected a Prisma server, the CLI writes the `endpoint` into prisma.yml as the default for future deploys. To bring up the interactive prompt again, simply remove the `endpoint` property from prisma.yml manually or pass the `--new` option.

### Usage

```bash
prisma1 deploy [flags]
```

### Flags

```
-d, --dry-run              Perform a dry-run of the deployment
-e, --env-file ENV-FILE    Path to .env file to inject env vars
-f, --force                Accept data loss caused by schema changes
-j, --json                 JSON Output
-n, --new                  Force interactive mode to select the cluster
-w, --watch                Watch for changes
--no-seed                  Disable seed on initial service deploy
```

### Examples

**Deploy service configuration in current directory**

```bash
prisma1 deploy
```

**Deploy service and interactively select a Prisma server as deployment target**:

```bash
prisma1 deploy --new
```

**Deploy service with environment variables specified in `.env.prod`**

```bash
prisma1 deploy --env-file .env.prod
```

## prisma generate

Invokes the _generators_ specified in `prisma.yml`. Available generators are:

The following generators are built-into the Prisma CLI:

- Prisma client in JavaScript: `javascript-client`
- Prisma client in TypeScript: `typescript-client`
- Prisma client in Flow: `flow-client`
- Prisma client in Go: `go-client`
- GraphQL schema of the Prisma API: `graphql-schema`

### Usage

```bash
prisma generate [flags]
```

### Flags

```
 -e, --env-file ENV-FILE    Path to .env file to inject env vars
```

### Examples

**Generate the TypeScript client and store the generated files at `./generated/prisma`**

`prisma.yml`:

```yml
generate:
    - generator: typescript-client
      output: ./generated/prisma
```

```bash
prisma generate
```

**Generate the Go client and the GraphQL schema store the generated files at `./generated/prisma`**

`prisma.yml`:

```yml
generate:
    - generator: go-client
      output: ./generated/prisma
    - generator: graphql-schema
      output: ./generated/prisma
```

```bash
prisma generate
```

## prisma introspect

Creates a [datamodel](knul) by _introspecting_ the schema of an existing database.

<Warning>

`prisma introspect` currently only works for Postgres databases.

</Warning>

The command launches an interactive wizard asking you to provide your database connection details:

- **Host**: The host of your Postgres server, e.g. `localhost`.
- **Port**: The port where your Postgres server listens, e.g. `5432`.
- **User & Password**: The credentials for your Postgres server.
- **Name of existing _database_**: The name of the Postgres _database_.
- **Use SSL (Yes/No)**: If your database connection is using SSL, you need to select `Yes`, otherwise `No`.
- **Name of existing _schema_**: The name of the Postgres _schema_, e.g. `public`.

Learn more about database introspection with Prisma [here](soi1).

### Usage

```sh
prisma introspect
```

### Examples

**Introspect an existing database**

```sh
prisma introspect
```

Here is a sample interaction where the database connection details are provided through the wizard:

```
? What kind of database do you want to introspect? Postgres
? Enter database host localhost
? Enter database port 5432
? Enter database user prisma
? Enter database password ****
? Enter name of existing database prisma-db
? Enter name of existing schema public

Introspecting database 402ms
Created datamodel mapping based on 7 database tables.

Created 1 new file:               

  datamodel-[TIMESTAMP].graphql    GraphQL SDL-based datamodel (derived from existing database)
```

The generated datamodel file will contain a timestamp in its name to avoid overriding your existing `datamodel.prisma` file.

## prisma1 login

Authenticate with [Prisma Cloud](https://www.prisma.io/cloud). 

This command opens the [Prisma Cloud Console](https://app.prisma.io/) where you need to sign up or sign in.

After a successful authentication in the browser, the CLI writes the `cloudSessionKey` into `~/.prisma/config.yml`. From there it is used for all subsequent requests made by the CLI against Prisma Cloud.

Note that rather than providing your cloud session key via the `--key` flag, you can also set the `PRISMA_CLOUD_SESSION_KEY` environment variable, this is especially useful for CI environments.

### Usage

```sh
prisma1 login [flags]
```

### Flags

```
-k, --key KEY    Cloud session key
```

### Examples

**Authenticate with Prisma Cloud (opens browser)**

```sh
prisma1 login
```

**Authenticate with Prisma Cloud by manually passing the cloud session key**

```sh
prisma1 login --key KEY
```

> In the above command, the `KEY` placeholder needs to be replaced with the value of your valid cloud session key. You can find the `cloudSessionKey` in `~/.prisma/config.yml`.

## prisma logout

Logout from [Prisma Cloud](https://www.prisma.io/cloud). 

This command simply deletes the `cloudSessionKey` from `~/.prisma/config.yml`.

### Usage

```sh
prisma logout
```

### Examples

**Log out of Prisma Cloud**

```sh
prisma logout
```

## prisma1 console

Opens the [Prisma Cloud Console](https://app.prisma.io/) in the browser.

### Usage

```sh
prisma1 console
```

### Examples

**Open the Prisma Cloud Console in the browser**

```sh
prisma1 console
```

## prisma1 account

Displays account information of the authenticated [Prisma Cloud](https://www.prisma.io/cloud) user (based on the `cloudSessionKey` in `~/.prisma/config.yml`). 

The displayed information includes:

- Username
- Email address

### Usage

```sh
prisma1 account
```

### Examples

**Display account information of the authenticated Prisma Cloud user**

```sh
prisma1 account
```
