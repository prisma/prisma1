## Overview

This page explains a number of important concepts to be aware of when working with the Prisma API.

Unless otherwise stated, the examples on this page are based on a Prisma API with the following datamodel:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  email: String @unique
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  title: String!
  published: Boolean! @default(value: "false")
  author: User
}
```

## Prisma GraphQL schema

The Prisma database is the [GraphQL schema](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e/) defining the data types and operations of a Prisma API. It is auto-generated and specifies CRUD and realtime operations for the models specified in the service's datamodel.

## Node selection

Many operations in the Prisma API only affect a subset of the existing nodes, sometimes only a single node, such as updating or deleting nodes.

In these case, you need a way to ask for _specific_ nodes in the API. This is what the `where` filter argument is being used for. It lets you specify _conditions_ for selecting the nodes to which an operation should be applied.

Nodes can be selected via any field that's annotated with the `@unique` directive.

Here are a few scenarios where node selection is required.

**Retrieve a single `User` node by its `email`**:

```graphql
query {
  user(where: {
    email: "alice@prisma.io"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```
```js
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "cjkawhcz44a4c0a84un9a86wt"
    }
  }
}
```

**Update the `title` of a single `Post` node**:

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(
    where: {
      id: "ohco0iewee6eizidohwigheif"
    }
    data: {
      title: "GraphQL is awesome"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```
```js
{
  "data": {
    "updatePost": {
      "id": "ohco0iewee6eizidohwigheif"
    }
  }
}
```

**Update `published` of a many `Post` nodes at once** (also see [Batch mutations](#batch-mutations)):

```graphql
mutation {
  updateManyPosts(
    where: {
      id_in: ["ohco0iewee6eizidohwigheif", "phah4ooqueengij0kan4sahlo", "chae8keizohmiothuewuvahpa"]
    }
    data: {
      published: true
    }
  ) {
    count
  }
}
```
```js
{
  "data": {
    "updateManyPosts": {
      "count": 3
    }
  }
}
```

## Batch mutations

One application of the node selection concept are the [batch mutations](qwe2#batch-mutations) exposed by the Prisma API. Batch updating or deleting is optimized for making changes to a large number of nodes. As such, these mutations only return _how many_ nodes have been affected, rather than full information on specific nodes.

For example, the mutations `updateManyPosts` and `deleteManyPosts` provide a `where` argument to select specific nodes, and return a `count` field with the number of affected nodes (see the example above).

```graphql
mutation {
  deleteManyUsers(
    where: {
      email_in: ["alice@prisma.io", "bob@prisma.io"]
    }
  ) {
    count
  }
}
```
```js
{
  "data": {
    "deleteManyUsers": {
      "count": 2
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>

Note that no [subscription](qwe3) events are triggered for batch mutations!

</Warning>

## Connections (Relay Pagination & Aggregations)

Prisma offers two approaches to retrieve a list of nodes via a relation field:

- Simple relation queries (_direct_ node retrieval):

  ```graphql
  query {
    posts {
      id
      title
      published
    }
  }
  ```

- Connections queries:

  ```graphql
  query {
    postsConnection {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
          published
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```


In contrast to the simple relation queries that _directly_ return a list of nodes, connection queries are based on the [Relay Connection](https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm) model. In addition to pagination information, connections in the Prisma API also have advanced features, like _aggregation_.

For example, while the `posts` query allows you to select specific `Post` nodes, sort them by some field and paginate over the result, the `postsConnection` query additionally allows you to _count_ all unpublished posts:

```graphql
query {
  postsConnection {
    # `aggregate` allows to perform common aggregation operations
    aggregate {
      count
    }
    edges {
      # each `node` refers to a single `Post` node
      node {
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```js
{
  "data": {
    "postsConnection": {
      "aggregate": {
        "count": 1
      },
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "title": "Watch all the talks from GraphQL Europe: bit.ly/gql-eu"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Transactions & Nested mutations

Single mutations in the Prisma API that are not batch operations are always executed _transactionally_, even if they consist of many actions that potentially spread across multiple related nodes. This is especially useful for [nested mutations](qwe2#nested-mutations) that perform several database writes on multiple types.

Nested mutations are mutations that are touching _at least_ two nodes, each of a different type. Here is a simple example:

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(data: {
    name: "Sarah"
    posts: {
      create: [
        { title: "GraphQL is great" }
        { title: "Prisma is a data access layer" }
      ],
      connect: [
        { id: "cjk1e3t7i1ark0b299pvrge5m" }
      ]
    }
  }) {
    id
    posts {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

This mutation touches **four** nodes in total:

- It _creates_ **one** new `User` node.
- It _creates_ **two** `Post` nodes. Both `Post` nodes are also directly _connected_ to the new `User` node.
- It _connects_ the new `User` node with **one** existing `Post` node.

This mutation performs **six** single actions in total:

- _Creating_ **one** `User` node.
- _Creating_ **two** `Post` nodes.
- _Connecting_ **three** `Post` nodes to the new `User` node.

If any of the mentioned actions fail (for example because of a violated `@unique` field constraint), the _entire_ mutation is rolled back!

Mutations are _transactional_, meaning they are [_atomic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)) and [_isolated_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)). This means that between two separate actions of the same nested mutation, no other mutations can alter the data. Also the result of a single action cannot be observed until the complete mutation has been processed.

## Cascading deletes

Prisma supports different _deletion behaviours_ for _relations_ in your datamodel. There are two major deletion behaviours:

- `CASCADE`: When a node with a relation to one or more other nodes gets deleted, these nodes will be deleted as well.
- `SET_NULL`:  When a node with a relation to one or more other nodes gets deleted, the fields referring to the deleted node are set to `null`.

As mentioned above, you can specify a dedicated deletion behaviour for the related nodes. That's what the `onDelete` argument of the `@relation` directive is for.

Consider the following example:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  comments: [Comment!]! @relation(name: "CommentAuthor", onDelete: CASCADE)
  blog: Blog @relation(name: "BlogOwner", onDelete: CASCADE)
}

type Blog {
  id: ID! @unique
  comments: [Comment!]! @relation(name: "Comments", onDelete: CASCADE)
  owner: User! @relation(name: "BlogOwner", onDelete: SET_NULL)
}

type Comment {
  id: ID! @unique
  blog: Blog! @relation(name: "Comments", onDelete: SET_NULL)
  author: User @relation(name: "CommentAuthor", onDelete: SET_NULL)
}
```

Let's investigate the deletion behaviour for the three types:

- When a `User` node gets deleted,
  - all related `Comment` nodes will be deleted.
  - the related `Blog` node will be deleted.
- When a `Blog` node gets deleted,
  - all related `Comment` nodes will be deleted.
  - the related `User` node will have its `blog` field set to `null`.
- When a `Comment` node gets deleted,
  - the related `Blog` node continues to exist and the deleted `Comment` node is removed from its `comments` list.
  - the related `User` node continues to exist and the deleted `Comment` node is removed from its `comments` list.

You can find more detailled info about the `@relation` directive and its usage [here](knul#the-@relation-directive).

<Warning>

Note that no [subscription](qwe3) events are triggered for cascading deletes!

## Authentication

A Prisma API can be protected with the _service secret_ (specified as the `secret` property) in your prisma.yml:

```yml
secret: my-secret-42
```

As the developer of a Prisma service, you can choose your own service secret. When a service gets deployed with a prisma.yml that contains the `secret` property, the Prisma API of that service will require authentication via a _service token_ (JWT):

![](https://i.imgur.com/cCmp8JI.png)

The easiest way to obtain a service token is by running the `prisma1 token` command inside the same directory where your prisma.yml is located:

```bash
$ prisma1 token
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJkYXRhIjp7InNlcnZpY2UiOiJkZW1vQGRldiIsInJvbGVzIjpbImFkbWluIl19LCJpYXQiOjE1MzI1ODgzNzAsImV4cCI6MTUzMzE5MzE3MH0.Nv8coqsiwdwoSfWCBJHYfnr0WK2GRyqO5xTN6Q3IVkw
```

The generated token needs to be attached to the `Autorization` header of the HTTP requests made to the Prisma API:

```bash
curl '__YOUR_PRISMA_ENDPOINT__' \\
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
-H 'Authorization: Bearer __YOUR_SERVICE_TOKEN__' \\
--data-binary '{"query":"mutation { createUser(data: { name: "Sarah" }) { id } }"'
```

<Warning>

The service secret and service tokens are not to be confused with the Prisma Management API secret used to protect the Management API of your Prisma server.
